# Features

Adds a context menu that lets you choose which editor group to open a file from the Explorer.

## Known Behavior and Workarounds

If you are annoyed that the Explorer view changes every time you switch the active editor group, search for `Explorer: Auto Reveal` (`explorer.autoReveal`) in settings and set it to `false`.

Even so, if you are annoyed that files opened from the Explorer do not land in the editor group you expected, this extension should help.
